            the primary flight control system by a variety of names. The types and complexity of 
            control mechanisms used depend on the size, speed, and mission of the aircraft.
             A small or low-speed aircraft may have cockpit controls connected directly to the 
            control surface by cables or pushrods. Some aircraft have both cable and pushrod system.
              The force exerted by the pilot is transferred through them to the control surfaces</p>
